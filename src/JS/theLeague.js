            <h3>Kyle "Streak" Bombardier</h3>
            <p>Bomby has been the commissioner of this group of ordinary gentleman since it's inception long ago. He's managed to bungle up quite a few things and has had three attempted coups against him, only to maintain power becasue Ricky flip-flops on everything league realted. Hes less popular than NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and that is saying something. However, he recently became a dad to a lovely daughter so we'll give him a pass once again(for now)</p>
            <p>Bomby is a two-time champion with continuous high hopes only to see then dashed come playoff time, much like his beloved Bronco. He's yet to win a Molly but he's close. His knack for hoarding RB's and neglecting other skill positions will inevitably blow up in his face. </p>
